# Python Extract `tar.gz` Files

`pyextract` is a Python tool for extracting files with the `.tar.gz` suffix from either **local** or **remote** paths to a specified output directory. It also supports extracting all `.gz` files at the same time.

**Additionally**, `pyextract` can merge all extracted files into a single new file. By default, the merged file is named `self.filename.log`, but you can customize the name using the `--merge_file` or `-m` option.

For example, consider a compressed package named `123456_abc.tar.gz` containing other compressed files and logs:

```shell
.
└── log
    └── file
        ├── 1.gz
        ├── 2.gz
        ├── 3.gz
        ├── 4.gz
        └── tmp.log
```

Inside the `.tar.gz` package, you may find multiple `.gz` files and a specific log file (e.g., `tmp.log`) to help locate the `.gz` files. You can freely modify the log file name as needed.

# Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Junbo-Zheng/pyextract
```

## Set Alias for Quick Access

Add the following alias to your shell configuration file for easier usage:

- For zsh:
    ```shell
    echo "alias pyextract='python3 $(pwd)/pyextract.py'" >> ~/.zshrc
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```
- For bash:
    ```shell
    echo "alias pyextract='python3 $(pwd)/pyextract.py'" >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

Some additional useful aliases are provided. Add them to your shell configuration file (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`) for quick access:

```bash
# Unzip the current .zip file (single file only)
alias zz='python3 $(pwd)/pyextract_unzip.py'

# Unzip all .gz files and merge them
alias gz='python3 $(pwd)/pyextract_gzlog.py'

# Unzip all .tar.gz files
alias tz='python3 $(pwd)/pyextract_targz.py'
```

After adding these aliases, restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc` (or `source ~/.bashrc`) to activate them.
You can then use `zz`, `gz`, or `tz` directly in your terminal for fast extraction operations.

# Usage

To see all available options, run:

```shell
./pyextract.py --help
```

Example output:

```
Parameter Number : 2
Shell Name       : ./pyextract.py
usage: pyextract.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT_PATH [OUTPUT_PATH ...]] [-P [PASSWORD]] -s SOURCE_PATH [SOURCE_PATH ...] [-m [MERGE_FILE]] -f FILENAME [-p] [-F FILTER_PATTERN]

Extract a file with the suffix `.tar.gz` from the source path or remote path and extract to output_path.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT_PATH [OUTPUT_PATH ...], --output_path OUTPUT_PATH [OUTPUT_PATH ...]
                        Output path for extracted files
  -P [PASSWORD], --password [PASSWORD]
                        Password for extraction and chmod
  -s SOURCE_PATH [SOURCE_PATH ...], --source_path SOURCE_PATH [SOURCE_PATH ...]
                        Source path(s) for extraction
  -m [MERGE_FILE], --merge_file [MERGE_FILE]
                        Merge extracted files into a new file
  -f FILENAME, --filename FILENAME
                        Filename to extract (default suffix is .tar.gz, e.g., log.tar.gz)
  -p, --purge_source_file
                        Delete source file after extraction
  -F FILTER_PATTERN, --filter_pattern FILTER_PATTERN
                        Filter pattern for files to be merged
```

## Supported Extraction Methods

You can extract files from both local and remote sources:

```shell
+------------------------+---------------------+
|        Android         |   -----------+      |
|         Phone          |              |      |
|  /sdcard/Android/data  |              |      |
+------------------------+             \|/     |
                                               |
                                              \|/    pyextract.py
                                               +-------------------> local output path
                                              /|\                  (./file path by default)
+----------------------+               /|\     |
|       Ubuntu         |                |      |
|        22.04         |                |      |
|  /home/mi/downloads  |     -----------+      |
+----------------------+-----------------------+
```

- **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**: To extract a `.tar.gz` file from a local path, run:

    ```shell
    ./pyextract.py --password 1234 --filename 123456_abc --source_path /Users/junbozheng/test
    ```

    If you have already downloaded the file, you can quickly extract it using `pyextract`.

- **Android Phone**: To extract a `.tar.gz` file from your phone, run:

    ```shell
    ./pyextract.py --password 1234 --filename 123456_abc --source_path phone
    ```

    `pyextract` will use the `adb pull` command to transfer files from your phone to your local machine and then extract them.
    Make sure your computer is connected to your phone via USB or other methods before running the command.
